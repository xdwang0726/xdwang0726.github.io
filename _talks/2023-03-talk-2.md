This talk discusses automatic MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) indexing, which assigns
MeSH terms to the MEDLINE citations. MeSH indexing is currently done by human annotators,
which is time-consuming and costly. An automatic annotation system is highly desired to help
with the indexing of large-scale articles. The occurrence of MeSH terms follows a long-tail
distribution, where some terms are much more frequent than others. Assigning the correct
number and terms of MeSH is the main challenge for the task. Previous work has focused on
leveraging the power of neural networks to improve thematic recognition of the text.
